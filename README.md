# Cortex

Welcome to **Cortex**! This repository serves as a centralized storage for notes across various engineering domains. Unlike detailed documentation or easily accessible official resources, Cortex focuses on capturing those "important but not often encountered" bits of knowledge that are typically hard to find or poorly documented.

## Contents

The notes in this repository are organized by domain and topic. You won't find basic concepts or easily accessible information here. Instead, Cortex is your go-to resource for:

- **Rarely encountered but crucial information**
- **Topics lacking comprehensive documentation**
- **Hard-to-find insights and best practices**

## Structure

The repository is structured to make it easy for you to find the notes you need. Each domain has its own directory, and within each domain, notes are categorized by specific topics.


## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have notes that fit the theme of this repository, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure your notes are clear, concise, and fit the "important but uncommon" knowledge criteria.
